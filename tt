Interested and experienced in web development, fullstack development, ui/ux development.
I like to innovate, test new ideas, think through new architecture of code.
For me nothing will compare in pleasure with good refactoring of some old code, 
only may be making some complex ui/ux decision.
And i make mobile games as a hobby.
